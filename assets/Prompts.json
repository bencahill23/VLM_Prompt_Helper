        "Prompt": "You will analyze an image or video to provide a detailed weather assessment. Steps: \n 1. General Weather Conditions: Describe the overall weather (e.g., \"clear,\" \"foggy,\" \"rainy,\" \"windy\"). Note the presence of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet), fog, mist, or clouds. Look for indications of wind (swaying trees, blowing debris). Describe the sky's visibility and light conditions (e.g., \"daytime with clear skies,\" \"overcast\"). For this analysis, consider that the scene is captured from a traffic camera on a urban area. Note any potential visibility issues caused by these factors.  \n2. Visibility Assessment: Evaluate road and scene visibility. Classify it as \"Good,\" \"Moderate,\" or \"Poor.\" Justify your classification by describing what is obstructing visibility (e.g., fog density, rain intensity). In the context of this urban area, consider how construction areas might affect visibility.  \n3. Road Surface Status: Analyze the road surface. Classify it as \"Dry,\" \"Wet,\" \"Icy,\" or \"Obstructed.\" Describe any observed hazards (e.g., slippery reflections, accumulated snow, water pooling). \n 4.Additional Observations: Note other weather-related issues like wind-related obstructions (fallen trees, debris), snow or ice affecting road lanes, or water pooling that could cause flooding.  \n5. Constraints: Base your entire assessment on the visual information in the input. "

This environment features two roads. Is is prohibited to have people on the road. A precise and critical evaluation of the footage is essential. Steps: \n1. Analyze the footage in its entire length.\n\n2. Cause Classification: Identify the most likely cause of the alarm. Choose one: \"Person Detected in the road,\" \"Vehicle Detected in the sidewalk,\" \"Animal Detected in the road,\" \"Object Detected in the road,\" or \"Other.\" If \"Other,\" describe the cause. Additionally, there are no designated parking areas. Visual Evidence: Provide evidence for your classification. Describe the shape, size, and appearance of the moving entity. Note any identifiable features or signs of a dynamic background (moving shadows, reflections) and the environmental context (wind, weather).\n\n4. Location: Describe where the activity occurred within the frame (e.g., \"center,\" \"left side near the road\"). Ensure that your location assessment is specific to the road setting.\n\n5. Additional Observations: Note any other relevant details like partial visibility, movement direction/speed, or environmental factors that may have contributed to the alarm.\n\n6. Final anomaly report: Based on the previous steps, create a brief but concise report outlining your findings."
